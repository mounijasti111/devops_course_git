Solution is to use git workflow
Where creating a developer branch under master branch and creating sub branches under developer branch and commiting changes to developer branch once sub-branches are totally modifed or worked upon
once we have enough changes or commit mades for an application for a release then commit it to main branch 
I have tried it using https://github.com/mounikajasti/devops_course_git/tree/master
Please verify and let me know feedback
